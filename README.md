As a Data Scientist from Flying Dust First Nation, I am committed to using my skills to benefit my community and other Indigenous communities. My passion is to apply cutting-edge technologies such as AI, ML, and DL, along with software engineering, to improve community planning and decision-making. 

I am attending the Automation and Digital Agriculture Specialist Program from Palette Skills, which consist of 130 hours of training. The goal of the program is to prepare me with the necessary skills and knowledge to implement technological solutions in the agricultural industry in Saskatchewan. The training is led by industry experts and includes hands-on, project-based learning in emerging technologies such as GIS, IoT, drones, AI, robotics, and big data. Through the program, I also developed professional skills in project management, business development, problem-solving, and team-building.
